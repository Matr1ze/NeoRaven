// Material 3 Expressive loading indicator.
//
// The M3E indicator is not an arc: a filled shape continuously morphs between the M3 forms
// (circle -> nine-sided "cookie" -> rounded square) while it rotates. Rendering it as a signed
// distance field keeps the silhouette clean at every intermediate shape - the morph never shows
// polygon facets because the SDF is sampled per pixel instead of being built from vertices.
//
// Two polygon fields (A and B) are blended instead of interpolating a single non-integer side
// count: a fractional side count leaves one wedge that does not close, which shows up as a seam
// running across the shape for the whole morph.
//
// localPos is the fragment's offset from the indicator centre in GUI pixels (see onyx_shape.vsh),
// so every uniform below is expressed in the same units as the UI.

/**
 * Signed distance to a regular polygon with `sides` edges, `apothem` from the centre to an edge and
 * `round` on top of that.
 *
 * The boundary is evaluated in polar form: inside one wedge the polygon's radius is
 * {@code apothem / cos(u)} (u measured from the edge normal), so adding {@code round} to that radius
 * moves the flat edges out by exactly `round` and turns every corner into a circular arc - which is
 * what makes the square form a rounded square instead of a sharp diamond. Offsetting the edge
 * planes would only inflate the polygon and keep the corners sharp.
